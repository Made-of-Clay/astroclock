# Astronomical Clock

This is a project I created several years ago to learn more about astronomical clocks. It displays the time of day, the current moon phase (approximately), and current zodiacal sign.

This project is in need of an update and will likely receive one soon. For now, it can be seen at [astroclock.adamleis.com](http://astroclock.adamleis.com).

Many updates have become available since 2013, so the next version of Astro Clock should be a considerable improvement.
